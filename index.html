			<h2>ABOUT THE FRANCHISE</h2>
			<p><strong><i>Walking with...</i></strong>, also referred to as <strong><i>Walking with Prehistoric Life</i></strong>, is a media franchise created by Tim Haines and Jasper James centered on a collection of documentary series produced by the BBC and created by the independent production company Impossible Pictures. The series of documentaries began with <strong><i>Walking with Dinosaurs</i></strong> (1999), which was followed by four more series; <strong><i>Walking with Beasts</i></strong> (2001), <strong><i>Walking with Cavemen</i></strong> (2003), <strong><i>Sea Monsters</i></strong> (2003) and <strong><i>Walking with Monsters</i></strong> (2005).<br>Dinosaurs, Beasts and Monsters form an overarching series within the franchise dubbed the <strong><i>Trilogy of Life</i></strong>. In addition to the main series, three special episodes have been produced; <strong><i>The Ballad of Big Al</i></strong> (2000), <strong><i>The Giant Claw</i></strong> (2002) and <strong><i>Land of Giants</i></strong> (2003).<br>The aim of the installments in the franchise is to recreate extinct animals and present them in the same way modern animals are presented in wildlife documentaries. The various extinct animals were realized throughout the franchise using computer graphics and animatronics.</p>
